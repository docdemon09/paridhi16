            <p>Dear Sara,</p>
            <p>Happy Birthday to the most amazing 16-year-old out there! ðŸŒŸ Today, as you step into this exciting chapter of life, I just want to remind you how incredible you are and how much potential you hold. ðŸ’•</p>
            <p>Remember, greatness isnâ€™t measured by what you achieve but by how kind and compassionate you are to the world around you. Keep being the beautiful soul you are, spreading love, laughter, and positivity wherever you go. Work hard, stay humble, and let your heart guide you to do good and be good.</p>
            <p>Chase your dreams, stand up for whatâ€™s right, and donâ€™t be afraid to stumble â€“ because every fall will make you stronger and wiser. Youâ€™ve got this, girl! ðŸ’ªâœ¨</p>
            <p>Stay awesome, stay kind, and keep being the sunshine in everyoneâ€™s lives. ðŸŒž</p>
            <p>Love,</p>
            <p>Retard ðŸ˜œ</p>
